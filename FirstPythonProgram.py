# variable is a name given to a memory location in a program
# variable names should be simple, short and meaningful

# Identifiers (They are names...eg. a variable name or a function name, etc. is an identifier):
# Identifiers can be a combination of uppercase & lowercase letters, digits or an underscore.
# Identifiers cannot start with a digit
# Identifiers can be of any length
# We can't use special symbols in our identifiers like !,@#$%^&*()-+=

# Data types:
# Python automatically detects the type(datatype) of values
# Data Types in Python : Integer(int), String(str), Float(float), Boolean(bool), None(NoneType)
# String can be writtn in single quotes, double quotes and triple quotes
# Possible vaues of boolean = True/False
# Eg: a = None (means a ko koi value nhi di gyi)

# Keywords:
# Keywords are reserver words which cannot be used as identifiers
# and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, finally, False, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal, None, not, or, pass, raise, return, True, try, with, while, yield
